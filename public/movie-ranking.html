<p>This is actually a great franchise because they have absolutely good movies knowing it's a superhero franchise<br>
They deliver well and the uniqueness of every superhero makes it more interesting since  will expect something different from al;osty every character<br>
</p>
<h3>TRANSFORMERS</h3>

<p>I am more of an action movie guy so i like a lot of movies with action and this one delivers differently.<br>
Such that there's alot of action scenes, the visual effects are amazing and the Big guy <b>OPTIMUS PRIME</b> getting to lead the Autobots is awesome as well with great story. </p>
<h3>FAST AND FURIOUS</h3>

    It just delivers well I can't really explain much.
